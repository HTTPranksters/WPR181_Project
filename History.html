    <p>The history of the internet dates all the way back to the 1960s, which is when the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S Department of Defence started the development 
        of the ARPANET. This network was created to connect various research institutions. These are some of the important milestones and when they were achieved: </p>

            <li>1962: J.C.R. Licklider introduced the concept of a “Galactic Network”, which was a vision of creating a globally connected set of computers. </li>
            <li>1965: Lawrence G. Roberts wrote down the first plan for the ARPANET, a network that would have allowed computers to be able to share their resources with each other. </li>
            <li>1969: The ARPANET was established, which connected the University of Los Angeles, the Stanford research institute, the university of Santa Barbra, and the university of
                 California, which was the birth of the internet. On the 29th of October the first message was sent, which was between the University of Los Angeles (UCLA) and the 
                 Stanford Research Institute (SRI). </li>
